                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Night Roast began with three lifelong friends — Ace, Lloyd, and Gino — who 
                    shared one ritual: sitting together over a cup of coffee, talking about life, 
                    dreams, and everything in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One night, gathered around a small table much like the one in the picture, 
                    the idea sparked: <strong>“Why don’t we build our own coffee shop?”</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Ace’s creativity, Lloyd’s craftsmanship, and Gino’s passion for flavor, 
                    they built a place that captures the warmth of their friendship — a café where 
                    stories, laughter, and good coffee never run out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Night Roast stands as a tribute to friendship, late-night conversations, 
                    and the belief that the best ideas are brewed together.
